# Admin Menu

Dashboard admin functionalities are available only for users having the global Admin role in the system.
Navigating admin options is available through the admin menu which is placed in the sidebar on the left.

## System Health
Displays server's system statistics. Consists of the following parts:  

### Cluster

### Heap Memory
It shows three statistics: maximum heap size, heap size in use and free (available) heap size. All these numbers are in MB. 
Additionally, it displays heap size in use as percent of maximum heap size.

### Partitions
It presents all available partitions - their path, total space nad free space (both numbers in GB) and used space as percent of the total space.

### Others
Shows basic settings for database logging:
#### DB Log Statement
Displays the level of logging for database operations, as returned by the database query
`SELECT setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'log_statement'`. Possible values:
* *none* - logging is turned off
* *ddl* - logs only ddl operations (like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`)
* *mod* - logs ddl operations and data-modifying statements (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
* *all* - logs everything

#### Min DB Statement Duration
Displays the minimum execution time above which all statements are logged. Value `-1` is equal to off.
Based on the result of the database query `SELECT setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'log_min_duration_statement'`.

### Task Statistics
Available only for Linux based servers. Requires sysstat tool being installed and enabled on the server.
Shows list of tasks currently being managed by the Linux kernel, as returned by the Linux command pidstat. 

## Logs
Allows to easily display a bunch of recent errors in the application. You can configure number of the errors visible (500 is default) and select which java classes should be included in the logging.

## Audit
Shows audit of important events in the application: user logging, create/update/delete of entities, errors that occured in the application.
It displays timestamp, id, IP address and description of the event. For errors it additionally allows to download full stack trace.
Search box to easily navigate through audit messages is also available.

frontend resource in the dashboard.

To do so, you need to:
1. Go to Admin -> Files,
2. Upload your logo,
3. Copy its `Absolute URL Path`,
4. Go to Admin -> Resources,
5. Find Frontend Resource with the name `main-page-fragments`,
6. Click on that name,
7. When on Frontend Resource settings page, edit the Draft Content by pasting the path you just copied into the src attribute of the logo image,
```
<th:block th:fragment="logo">
<img class="logo" src="/your-logo-path.svg"/>
</th:block>
```
8. Save,
9. In table of Resources, row of `main-page-fragments`, pick dropdown in the column 'Draft' and select action 'Push To Live'.

#### Setup Logo Sent In Emails

Set up the logo which should be displayed in email messages sent from the application by setting 
the logo's path in the .properties file:
```
application.logo=/path/to/your/logo.png
```

_Important: The logo element needs to be present in application's email templates html to be visible in email messages. 
Below, there's an example of html code which would insert the logo image into the message._

```
<img src="cid:logo.png" alt="MyAppLogo"/>
```

## Auth methods

###General configuration

Openkoda allows to login with multiple authentication methods. Each of them requires definition of (some of) the following properties:

#### clientId
The application ID received after app registration in the appropriate authentication provider (e.g. Facebook App, Linkedin App etc.)

#### clientSecret
The application secret key received after app registration in the appropriate authentication provider (e.g. Facebook App, Linkedin App etc.)

#### accessTokenUri
URL used to obtain the access token

#### userAuthorizationUri
URL to which the user is to be redirected to authorize the access token

#### tokenName
The name of an access token used when sending requests with the token authentication. Default value is `access_token`.

#### scope
The scope of an access token

#### clientAuthenticationScheme
Method of transmitting client authentication credentials when obtaining an access token.
Possible values:
* *header* - send as the Authorization http header
* *query* - send a query parameter in the URI
* *form* - send in the form body
* *none* - do not send at all

The default value is `header`.

#### authenticationScheme
Method of transmitting a token when sending requests with the token authentication.
Possible values:
* *header* - send as the Authorization http header
* *query* - send a query parameter in the URI

## User Session

### Session Timeout

We can easily configure the Session timeout value of the embedded server using properties:

<code>
server.servlet.session.timeout
</code>

If a duration suffix is not specified, seconds will be used. The default value is <code>30m</code>.
For a value of <code>-1</code> the session will not expire.

## Multitenancy

### Organization Delete

In case of multitenancy setup with many schemas, there's a separate schema created in the database per organization. 
Organization schemas are named following the pattern `org_<organization-ID>`, so for organization with the ID 121, schema name would be `org_121`.


In case of organization delete, Openkoda renames the schema of the deleted organization to `deleted_<organization-ID>`. 
So for the example mentioned above, the renamed schema name would be `deleted_121`.


## Integrations
You can integrate Openkoda with plenty of applications using the `.properties` file. 
Properties for each application are described in this section.

# Maintenance

## Log files

By default, Openkoda will only log to the console and will not write log files. 
To enable writing log files in addition to the console output you need to set the `logging.file`
property in `.properties` file.

**Example**
```
logging.file=app.log
```

To set the logging level you need to set the `logging.level.<logger-name>=<level>` property in 
`.properties` file. 

To set the logging level for all packages you should put `root` in place of `<logger-name>`. 
In case you want to set the logging level for the specific package you should put the package in place of `<logger-name>`.  

Level can be one of the following values: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, OFF.

**Example**
```
logging.level.root=DEBUG
logging.level.com.openkoda=DEBUG
```

## Application Tracking

### Logs

When logged into the Global Admin account in Openkoda it is possible to review logs actions history from there.

To review Logs, go to `Admin -> Logs`. There you can find a table with two columns representing log entries, 
first is the identification key, the second is log content.

#### Download

To download the logs click the button in the top right corner of the Logs card.

#### Settings

It is possible to change the logging scope by enabling or disabling particular loggers in the application. 
There's a button named `Settings` in the top right corner of the Logs card. It will redirect you to Logs settings page 
where you can enable loggers from the list of all available ones for the application. 

Once enabled, logs for selected loggers can be tracked in the Logs table. 

### Audit

Go to `Admin -> Audit` to review table containing the history of operations for the application. It is possible to filter 
content by typing ids or keywords in the search box in the top right corner of the Audit card.

For any entity properties considered as large content there's a button named `Content`. It is visible at the end of rows 
and triggers the download of a file containing the content. Due to its size it cannot be displayed in the table. 


## System Health

#### Dashboard

Go to `Admin -> System Health` to review system health dashboard.
It presents information about partitions and its usage, heap memory and other available data. 

#### Properties

In `.properties` file there are properties which point to system health check executables. These can be edited 
accordingly to your operating system and tools available.

```
system.cat.executable=cat
system.pidstat.executable=pidstat
system.apt.executable=apt
```

Openkoda reviews RAM, CPU and disk usage in a scheduled job. It produces error logs for any system health properties
outreaching percentage max limits.
Max limits have default values set to 75 percent and can be changed in `.properties` file.

```
max.disk.percentage=75
max.ram.percentage=75
max.cpu.percentage=75
```
