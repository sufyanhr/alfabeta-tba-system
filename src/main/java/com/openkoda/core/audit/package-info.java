/**
 *
 * <p>Implementation of Hibernate Interceptor that creates Audit Logs for selected entities.</p>
 * <br/>
 * <p>
 * The setup is following:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Interceptor is configured in application.properties with:
 *   <code>spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.ejb.interceptor.session_scoped=com.openkoda.core.audit.PropertyChangeInterceptor</code></li>
 *   <li> The session_scoped type makes is thread safe
 *   (each hibernate session gets its own instance of the interceptor) </li>
 *   <li> To make a entity class auditable,
 *   implement {@link com.openkoda.model.common.AuditableEntityOrganizationRelated}
 *   or {@link com.openkoda.model.common.AuditableEntity}
 *   and register the class in {@link com.openkoda.core.customisation.BasicCustomisationService}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p><b>Should I put a class into this package?</b></p>
 * <p>It's a closed functionality, so probably not unless you want to enhance it.</p>
